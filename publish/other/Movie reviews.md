# tailor of panama

part of safe
he's opening a safe whilst flirting with the female lead. 
he's messing with the lock as he's hinting that the lock (her couscous ) was locked in a warehouse. 
she takes him on the seduction and asks him 
are you sure it was locked in the first place? 
he takes thr chance to ask her out, she refuses
then he replies :the safe was open, just tight from lack of use. 


# Its a wonderful life
Remember, no man who has friends is a failure

This movie was beautiful, shows how he stuck to his values even when things went rough, and he had a wife who supported him along the way

- nice movie there's a polarity between alpha and beta male. "you're money, baby" "

her butt only flies business class 

Waiting - didn't like it very frat party movie 

# office space - nice! the guy gets all manly for about 10 mins of the movie
