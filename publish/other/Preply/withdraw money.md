I also withdraw to a UK bank account. I recommend the following. Wise is best. It has a fixed charge and a decent exchange rate.

1. Open a Wise account.
    
2. When you withdraw your money, convert it into GBP directly.
    
3. There is a fixed charge of less than £1.
    
4. Withdraw to a GBP account in your Wise account directly, not to your bank via Wise. That way it's instant. You can then instantly transfer from your Wise account to your bank account in the UK with no extra charge. Your GBP account in Wise acts like any other UK account.
    

Note: If you use Wise as a payment processor to transfer from Preply "straight" to your UK bank account, it can take many days sometimes. You won't save any money doing it either.

5. Let your money build up a bit with Preply. This reduces the percentage charge.

Just a note about the 33% commission, don't worry, it shouldn't take you long to go to lower tiers.
