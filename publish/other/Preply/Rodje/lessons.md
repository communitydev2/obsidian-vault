Color correction is taking footage and correct things (white balance, things look off)

Raw files have no color correction models from the phone

colour grading is where setting the mood

There are different types of scopes (parade, )
- 0 means darkest, top is bright area
- There are lows, midtones, and highs


On the wheels
- Lift - control lows, meaning, darker areas of the shot
- Gamma - Midtones section
- Gain - Highs, brightest colors
- Offset - master volume, moving everything at once

- Primary Log wheels
	- Is more precise, doesn't move the bar up too much (say shadows, moves only the lows area, not the rest)
