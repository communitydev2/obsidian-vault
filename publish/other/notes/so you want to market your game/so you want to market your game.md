I worked as a video editor and game capture artist on these games. I did a few trailers for some of these games and captured game for them, so if I didn't do the trailer for one of the titles, some of the footage you see on the final trailers it was me playing the game behind the screen.

I've worked with several developers  and have assembled a list of do's and don'ts throughout the development of game when it comes to marketing.

### Step 1 - Get your game noticed
share your progress
Spending 12h on development? take some time off from development, share your progress online, look for communities who you think would love playing what you're making.
code live

great examples is undertale , he was very active online, sharing his projects , and then had a successful kickstarted, and the rest was history

show Sunny lab bakery witch in paris, they've been sharing their progress since day one, from when it was only a concept, also created a kickstarter, got their game signed with a publisher, and 4 years later, the game is releasing this year

don't hardcode your strings, make them editable from a single file for localization

be patient. 

It's best that you make people aware of your game early so that you will have a audience by the time you are ready to show people your game.

stardew valley - developer worked as a usher for 5 years whilst developing the game, but people were aware of it long before the game came out.

### Step2 - I got a playable prototype. Now what?

Publishers

They are many, and they are out there waiting for your game.

Search for game scouts and reach out with a playable prototype , take as much feedback as possible, get your game on the hands of as many people as possible. 

During university you have people who are in the same boat as you, show them , take feedback, and see how it goes.

For this stage

Let's say you have signed your game with a publisher, you will work with the marketing team. From experience, there are a number of features your game should have to make everyone's lives easier to market your game

turn ui off
option to choose the platform for your visible game controller ui or separate it from your original ui, so we don't have to manually edit it out. 
turn audio off
provide easy teleports to different sections of your game 
ability to spawn the actors of your game
access different states of your boss
in multiplayer games, allow for camera controls where one player can be on god mode and activate things for the other player to see and interact
create a audio moodboard - what artists fit your gams. 
don't gatekeep your game assets 
be open to suggestions
