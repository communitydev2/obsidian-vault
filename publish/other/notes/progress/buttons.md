- she pretends to not listen to me, which riles me up I need to be calm, be aware of what I said, and if it reiterates on something that she is iffy against, she is just trying to diminish me.

- wehn she told me : make your own tea, I should have acted cool nad say: but I prefer when it's made from this beautiful lady here. And if she pressed on, just laugh and continue doing your thing.
- 19/1/26 - came again to bust my balls . 
since I told her about the book I'm reading, she started to be pushy. I told her to stop it cause I was going to go. At that point, I should have gone to the other house, instead I went to the lounge and she kept being bitchy. I left my center and she felt it. After that I was upset and started complaining about it. I think next time I gotta own up to her, and just have a conversation without being afraid. 
even if I'm pissed off and horny, I should keep it to myself. 
Apanhou-me a hacer una paja. 
saying I am doing nothing to get a new job
13/1/26 - I changed. 
That’s the best compliment she could have given me. You don’t tell me anything. You come to bed without telling me to come to bed. You’re keeping it zipped.


belittling me about my “lack of efforts getting a job”. I CANNOT LET HER GET UNDER MY SKIN. 
She’s testing you. Remember cinderella man? She didn’t support him, and he still did it anyway. THAT’S MALE ENERGY.
Said she’s using my mug so I would stand up
Acted superior when she saw the drawer of the fridge was not opening, asking when is it getting fixed. She doesn’t cook, so I’m telling her “if I’m the man and fix things, you’re the woman and you should cook nad clean.
I please her, then she blows me off / promises to make up to me, even though she’s done that promise before and didn’t kept it (once in 15/12/25, second in 12/1/26)
That’s fine honey, did you enjoy it?
