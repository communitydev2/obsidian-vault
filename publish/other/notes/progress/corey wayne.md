If you’re not dating exclusively, never set day dates, only set romantic dates (things happening at night, where sex CAN HAPPEN)
The only distance you’re willing to go for is from your chair to your front door, to let her in.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPQMWR5trGY
You stopped doing the things you used to do that would court her.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW0xfHL8AQE
When a woman backs away, you back away. 
When she starts touching you again, then you take it a litte further. You might have to do this a few times over.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzSTYZNQuTc
You can only find people who love you if you love yourself.

Masculine energy is calm, not perturbed.
Strongest negotiating position is to be able to walk away and mean it
Tell her she has to be nice
You need to walk away when she’s being rude.
Men who understand women don’t argue with them
ALWAYS SET BOUNDARIES

https://youtu.be/3D6ru4OpY4o?si=auIQVzhQw_U72HJ9
if you tell her everything, there is nothing to discover about you. 
it's why hellotalk is useless for meeting women unless they live close to you 

https://youtu.be/ZfyW5xcfI6w?si=4eOhC5XOpAaVg0iZ
you got nothing to prove to women. 
act un bothered if they bring up exes. 


https://youtu.be/9przgis3pLM?si=Oviab4R_iZfPSNRC
try to remove her clothes. if she rebukes, wait a bit longer keep your cool, keep talking, then try again later. 
don't apologise, just keep your cool and keep things relaxed 
https://youtu.be/qH3VnuYcAN8?si=uepeiDYUwvU9-vj4
never meet a woman for lunch 
if she says “im sick so I can't come
“I'm sure you don't want to impress me with snot coming out of your nose”
visualize 
I want to be free, unafraid of being alone
I imagine a popular stream 
people ask me for software, I deliver 
I get tipped well on a monthly basis. 
I can create the software I want
I'm surrounded by people who love my company 
I am confident around others
I can network without feae

Marriage , kids , HAS TO BE HER TO BRINGING IT UP


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHXRYraMaDg
If she complains you’re not giving her attention, DON’T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. It means SHE NOTICED, so you’re on the RIGHT TRACK.
IF SHE COMPLAINS , tell her WHY DON’T YOU DO MORE?
She projects her knowledge of her lack of attention, she complains to you BECAUSE YOU’RE THE LEADER ON THE RELATIONSHIP!
You’re giving her the best resource she can have : YOU.
You go into a relationship to give
Female attraction grows through motivation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8JhLYTwfSY (fits my situation)
Get her to open her emotions about her dad dying, you need to get her emotions to understand what’s 
If you’re feeling pain in a relationship, it means you’re focusing on yourself.
Need to focus on making her laugh
Pattern interrupt
When you see her being negative, interrupt her by being silly
the horse always comes back to the barn. 
sex is the man's fault. you must be the one to say sex is ok. 
what do you do in a town with nothing to do? you're the fun
never seek their approval. 
my buttons

19/1/26 - came again to bust my balls . 
since I told her about the book I'm reading, she started to be pushy. I told her to stop it cause I was going to go. At that point, I should have gone to the other house, instead I went to the lounge and she kept being bitchy. I left my center and she felt it. After that I was upset and started complaining about it. I think next time I gotta own up to her, and just have a conversation without being afraid. 
even if I'm pissed off and horny, I should keep it to myself. 
Apanhou-me a hacer una paja. 
saying I am doing nothing to get a new job
13/1/26 - I changed. 
That’s the best compliment she could have given me. You don’t tell me anything. You come to bed without telling me to come to bed. You’re keeping it zipped.


belittling me about my “lack of efforts getting a job”. I CANNOT LET HER GET UNDER MY SKIN. 
She’s testing you. Remember cinderella man? She didn’t support him, and he still did it anyway. THAT’S MALE ENERGY.
Said she’s using my mug so I would stand up
Acted superior when she saw the drawer of the fridge was not opening, asking when is it getting fixed. She doesn’t cook, so I’m telling her “if I’m the man and fix things, you’re the woman and you should cook nad clean.
I please her, then she blows me off / promises to make up to me, even though she’s done that promise before and didn’t kept it (once in 15/12/25, second in 12/1/26)
That’s fine honey, did you enjoy it?




levantarse e fazer de conta que vem ter comigo e eu vieri me instantâneamente. 
quando ela tocou no meu brbr e eu mexi e ela riu se. 
vir ter comigo mas estar a olhar para o que está a acontecer na televisão 
fala calmo para tirar os fones
mexer na brbr e depois recusar qualquer tipo de avanço
criticarme por qualquer coisa, mesmo que esteja errada
quando estou a masturbar e ela abre a porta, 
senta te na sanita, não digas nada. fica calado como nada se passasse. 
dizme que sou um homem noivado, e que não sou em condições por sair à noite. 
Don't say one thing and do another 
mirror her actions
good questions
what are you passionate about 
what do you love in life 
what is the craziest thing you ever done 
what's the most exciting place you've had sex in public 
what do you like to do for fun
do you remember your first day at school 
what do you love but are afraid to admit that you love 
what's unique and exciting about you 
what are your guilty pleasures 
what did your friends love most about you 
what makes life exciting to you 
what's your biggest dream 
what are you most proud of 
funniest things that happened to you 
What’s the most fun you’ve ever had?
How do you know when a guy is right for you? What specifically makes him stand out from the rest?
What do your friends admire most about you?
Have you ever fallen in love just by looking into someone’s eyes? If she says yes, ask her specifically what it was that made them stand out from the rest: Their smile, clothes, body language, how they looked at you, tone of their voice, etc.? What was their “hook” that made them irresistible to you?
What makes you really happy?
What cracks you up more than anything?
What is the silliest thing you’ve ever done?
What is your favorite memory?
What is the funniest movie you’ve ever seen?
Have you ever been very mischievous and done things like put Mr. Bubble in a large water fountain, and then came back later to see the bubbles everywhere?
Have you ever farted and then blamed it on someone else successfully like an older relative?
What is the most fun you ever had on a date?
What’s the one thing you can’t say no to?
What are you really good at that would surprise me?
If you could wake up tomorrow and be anyplace in the world, where would it be? Why?
linguagem corporal - bebida na mão no lado do bolso, não à frente do peito. 
manter contacto visual, costas para cima. 
não tens nada a provar a mulher nenhuma.
se não tiveres a atenção de uma mulher, vais continuar a ser a pessoa que és? as mulheres testam te para saber isso
sempre que uma mulher encontra uma fraqueza, ela vai escavar essa fraqueza, ou seja, ela vai fazer mais do que ela fez da primeira vez que te infuriou
não estejas sempre a contar coisas negativas 
leva as coisas com humor, nunca deixes o drama dela liderar a conversa, independentemente do quanto ela puxar
por exemplo, se ela parar de cozinhar, aqueces um prato vazio, e depois começas a comer à beira dela até ela reparar que estás a comer de um prato vazio. 
When she's upset, until she says she feels better, things haven't settled 
you're a boat, ans you can't let her rock your boat. 
avançar mesmo que a tua mulher discorde contigo. 
quando fizeres encontros nunca decidas se vai acontecer por ti. Deixa a responder oara averiguar a resposta dela, nunca aceitar um “depois ligo a confirmar”
não trates as mulheres como celebridades, elas são pessoas normais
