Abraham Lincoln - ridiculed a guy, shields challenged him to a duel.

improve yourself rather than try others 





al capone, blaming other people other than himself, regarding him as a public benefactor 

## principle 2 - make people feel important and appreciated

things come from urges of sex and desire to be important 

food, sleep, money, life in the thereafter, sexual gratification, desire of being important 


abraham Lincoln says everyone likes to be complimented. 

craving to be appreciated 


call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly 

let the other person save face

people fake invalidity so that they feel import. 
people will go insane so they gain the validation they're looking for. 

woman wasn't loved by husband, didn't had children, so she went crazy, saying that she had divorced her husband, and had new children every day 

if you make people feel appreciated, imagine what you can achieve.
