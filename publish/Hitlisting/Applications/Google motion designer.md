Here are the reasons why I am the best fit for this role:
- I have 5 years of Motion Designing experience.
- I've been building several solutions for several creative challenges for Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator and Python. Happy to share the github repository on request.
	- In after Effects:
		-  A script that used a custom generated template where it takes a video, and generates all the necessary video templates for all the game platforms (Xbox, Sony, Nintendo, Steam , GOG, and other game distributing platforms). This script was a great addition to the team as it greatly reduced human error when it came to different specifications for each game platform, such as naming conventions, audio and graphics required. Improved workflow by 30%.
		- A script that took a few codes set by another Illustrator script where for each imported Illustrator layer, it would generate one out of 16 script-generated After Effects Templates (also scripted by me) according to the storyboard given by stakeholders (ZARA at the time). As the generation of these templates was happening, dialogs would pop up and ask for what text to go on each section, and all the text would be generated accordingly in its corrected positions. At the end, when rendering, these scripts would place the videos with the correct naming convention, in the correct folders, with 1 click only. This workflow revolutionized my team , where the correct file naming conventions were followed so that my scripts would work seamlessly with the storyboards provided.
		- A panel that connects properties from layers into a top level null that allows you to control and animate your desired properties from a single layer rather than having to animate on separate layers, taking much longer.
		- Stretch a selected layer (or all layers) by converting to Time Remap and adjust their duration to fit the composition's duration
		- Connect several layers to a single null layer to move and scale all at once
		- separate dimensions on all selected layers
		- separate Masks from selected layers
		- Apply a desired expression (like loopOut() or something similar) to several layers at once.
		- Emulate the shine effect on a text
		- generate random paths for a graphic to be animated quickly without many intervention
	- In Photoshop I created scripts to:
		-  Export all layers to png layers
		- Rename layers inside a selected folder
		- Take in a custom photoshop template with all setup so that each saved image would have a game UI that would get randomized each time (health bar, weapon icon, item number). This script was very useful when leading with feedback and having to change 40 different screenshots every feedback loop.
		- Align a number of selected layers horizontally , with same height, and same distance between each other, used for endslates in video game trailers.
	- In Illustrator, I created scripts to:
		- Read 6 panels in each page of a storyboard , and recognize which template out of 16 after effects templates was it intended for. It would then rename the layer accordingly with folder number, composition duration, and number of template. This modified storyboard would then centre everything accordingly in each page , and export the PDF. This illustrator file would then be imported into After effects to work with another script I mention above.
		- Alter the character emphasis between Bold and Italic in a title with the press of a button.
	- In Python,I created scrips to:
		- Time track Tasks, create groups and separate tasks and time how long it takes to achieve a task
		- Custom File Explorer where I was able to add paths and links to a group of items. This allowed me to save separate links , folder paths in groups and Sub Groups which gave me a much more customizable tool than Windows's default File Explorer.
		- Rename Files using a custom file naming convention
		- Copy a file project with a new file name convention.
		- Convert videos into gifs with file size below 8mb so that it can be shared on social media.
- I have used ComfyUI for different projects.
- I've worked for several different Industries, such as ZARA, NHS, HSS, English National Ballet, David LLoyd, Slimming world, and the games industry (Team17 and Thunderful Games).
- I have a Bachelors degree in Games Design.
