Here are the reasons why I am the best fit for this role:
- I have 5 years of video editing experience
- I've been building several solutions for several creative challenges for Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere. Happy to share the github repository on request.
	- In after Effects:
		-  A script that used a custom generated template where it takes a video, and generates all the necessary video templates for all the game platforms (Xbox, Sony, Nintendo, Steam , GOG, and other game distributing platforms). This script was a great addition to the team as it greatly reduced human error when it came to different specifications for each game platform, such as naming conventions, audio and graphics required. Improved workflow by 30%.
		- A script that took a few codes set by another Illustrator script where for each imported Illustrator layer, it would generate one out of 16 script-generated After Effects Templates (also scripted by me) according to the storyboard given by stakeholders. As the generation of these templates was happening, dialogs would pop up and ask for what text to go on each section, and all the text would be generated accordingly in its corrected positions. At the end, when rendering, these scripts would place the videos with the correct naming convention, in the correct folders, with 1 click only. This workflow revolutionized my team , where the correct file naming conventions were followed so that my scripts would work seamlessly with the storyboards provided.
		- A panel that connects properties from layers into a top level null that allows you to control and animate your desired properties from a single layer rather than having to animate on separate layers, taking much longer.
		- Stretch a selected layer (or all layers) by converting to Time Remap and adjust their duration to fit the composition's duration
		- Connect several layers to a single null layer to move and scale all at once
		- separate dimensions on all selected layers
		- separate Masks from selected layers
		- Apply a desired expression (like loopOut()) to several layers at once.
		- Emulate the shine effect on a text
		- generate random paths for a graphic to be animated quickly without many intervention
