    Hi Marnie! I wanted to reach out and say hi! I see you, like myself, made the switch from another industry to tech later in life. Would you be open for a quick coffee chat? I am interested in hearing about how you made the switch.

    Hi Alex! Im looking to meet new friends in tech outside my current circle, especially those in front-end. Do you ever do coffee chats with newer devs? I’d love to get some career advice from those with more experience. Thanks !

    Hi Gunther! I’ve been making an effort to meet more people in tech and your career progression really spoke to me! Would you have 15 minutes to chat sometime? Thanks! P.S. 390 day streak and counting ;)
Do you still code outside of work?

    Allows them to talk about any personal projects they are working on. Allows you to show interest in them outside what they have to offer as an employee of whatever company they are working at.

What is your dream job, if not your current position?

    I like this question because it allows them to talk about any goals they might have and also a safe opportunity for them to say why their current position might now be their ideal, gives them a chance to say reasons why they might want to move on and those might be important for you.

Do you see yourself working in tech for the rest of your career? What would you do if you had another job?

    One of my favorite questions to ask people! Even people I meet outside of coffee chats. Always gives good insight into the person and allows you to talk about things other than code (Which is a good thing). Maybe they would be a master beer brewer or a librarian. Its a fun chat and they’ll likely ask you the same question in return.

Do you have any advice for me in my current position? What would you do in my shoes?

    This question can be tailored to any situation. Job hunting, growing in your career, branching out to a different kind of tech. Be clear about WHAT you’re asking. For example if you were a backend dev stuck on backend tasks at work but you dreamed of working on the front end. Explain your situation and then ask this question.
