    Hi Marnie! I wanted to reach out and say hi! I see you, like myself, made the switch from another industry to tech later in life. Would you be open for a quick coffee chat? I am interested in hearing about how you made the switch.

    Hi Alex! Im looking to meet new friends in tech outside my current circle, especially those in front-end. Do you ever do coffee chats with newer devs? I’d love to get some career advice from those with more experience. Thanks !

    Hi Gunther! I’ve been making an effort to meet more people in tech and your career progression really spoke to me! Would you have 15 minutes to chat sometime? Thanks! P.S. 390 day streak and counting ;)
