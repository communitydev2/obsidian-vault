I started coding 14 years ago using Actionscript, an Object Oriented programming language, where I’ve developed web applications and games 

  

In my A levels I’ve studied CS, where I learned web development and learned how to develop web applications.

  

During that time I’ve developed websites for clients from different backgrounds, such as restaurants, and art galleries. ( bar azul gaia, galeria porto website with custom file structure)

  

I went to university to study Game development, and there I developed different games using different engines. 

  

I’ve taught myself languages such as C# and unrealscript to develop mobile applications.

  

I also worked as a game developer in the games industry, using C#

  

I decided to continue to further my learning in web development, and have worked freelance for a few years, mostly with a client and helped developing and managing the stock and database of a recycled electronics company for a while,

  

When I moved into the agency 100Devs, then I moved on to the current project, cookServeRepeat, which is a web application for communication between servers, front and back of house.
